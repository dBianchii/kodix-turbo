# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This section contains Architecture Decision Records that document important architectural decisions made for the Kodix platform, including the context, decision rationale, and consequences.

## üìÅ Decision Records

### [Lessons Learned](./lessons-learned.md)
Historical lessons learned from architectural decisions and implementation experiences.

## üîç üéØ ADR Overview

**Quick Summary**: Key points for rapid AI context understanding.
<!-- /AI-COMPRESS -->
Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) are lightweight documents that capture important architectural decisions along with their context and consequences. They help teams understand why decisions were made and provide a historical record for future reference.

### ADR Template Structure
```markdown
# ADR-XXX: [Decision Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
[What is the issue that we're seeing that is motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by the change that will need to be mitigated.]

### Positive
- [List positive consequences]

### Negative  
- [List negative consequences]

### Neutral
- [List neutral consequences]

## Implementation
[How will this decision be implemented?]

## References
- [Links to relevant documents, discussions, or external resources]
```

## üìã Planned ADRs

The following ADRs are planned to document key architectural decisions:

### ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection
- Document rationale for React 19, Next.js 15, tRPC v11
- Include performance benchmarks and ecosystem considerations
- Explain migration path from previous versions

### ADR-002: tRPC v11 Migration Strategy
- Document the critical import patterns and breaking changes
- Explain web vs mobile app API differences
- Include validation tooling decisions and patterns

### ADR-003: SubApp Architecture Pattern
- Document the team-based isolation model
- Explain configuration system design
- Include inter-SubApp communication patterns

### ADR-004: Database Architecture with Drizzle ORM
- Document ORM selection rationale over alternatives
- Explain schema design patterns and conventions
- Include migration strategies from previous solutions

### ADR-005: Multi-Tenancy Implementation
- Document team-based isolation approach
- Explain data segregation strategies
- Include security and performance considerations

## üöÄ ADR Process

### Creating ADRs
1. **Identify Decision**: Recognize when an architectural decision needs documentation
2. **Draft ADR**: Use the template to document the decision
3. **Review Process**: Get input from relevant stakeholders
4. **Decision**: Accept, reject, or request modifications
5. **Implementation**: Update documentation and communicate decision

### ADR Lifecycle
- **Proposed**: Initial draft, under discussion
- **Accepted**: Approved and being implemented
- **Deprecated**: No longer recommended, but not removed
- **Superseded**: Replaced by a newer decision

### Maintenance
- Review ADRs periodically for relevance
- Update status as decisions evolve
- Link related ADRs for context
- Archive outdated decisions with historical context

## üìö Benefits of ADRs

### Decision Transparency
- Clear rationale for architectural choices
- Historical context for future decisions
- Stakeholder alignment on direction

### Knowledge Management
- Capture institutional knowledge
- Onboard new team members faster
- Avoid repeating past mistakes

### Decision Quality
- Force explicit consideration of alternatives
- Document trade-offs and consequences
- Enable informed future decisions

## üîß Implementation Guidelines

### When to Create ADRs
- Significant architectural changes
- Technology stack decisions
- Design pattern adoptions
- Security or performance trade-offs
- Cross-team impact decisions

### ADR Best Practices
- Keep them concise but complete
- Focus on the decision, not implementation details
- Include measurable consequences where possible
- Link to supporting documentation
- Update status as decisions evolve
