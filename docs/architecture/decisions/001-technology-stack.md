# ADR-001: Technology Stack Selection

## Status
Accepted

**Date**: 2025-07-12  
**Stakeholders**: Architecture Team, Development Teams, Platform Team  
**Review Date**: 2026-01-12

## Context

### Background
The Kodix platform required a comprehensive technology stack that would support:
- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- Real-time features (chat, collaboration)
- AI integration capabilities
- Mobile and web applications
- High performance and scalability requirements

### Problem Statement
We needed to select a modern, maintainable, and scalable technology stack that would enable rapid development while ensuring type safety, performance, and developer experience.

## Decision

We have selected the following technology stack for the Kodix platform:

### Frontend Stack
- **React 19**: Latest React version with improved performance and developer experience
- **Next.js 15**: App Router for modern routing and SSR/SSG capabilities
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode for complete type safety
- **Tailwind CSS v4**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **ShadCN/UI**: High-quality component library built on Radix UI

### Backend Stack
- **tRPC v11**: Type-safe API layer with end-to-end TypeScript integration
- **Drizzle ORM**: Modern TypeScript ORM with excellent type inference
- **MySQL**: Reliable RDBMS for primary data storage
- **Redis**: In-memory caching and session management
- **Node.js 22**: Latest LTS runtime environment

### Development & Infrastructure
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment
- **pnpm**: Fast, efficient package manager
- **ESLint**: Code quality and consistency enforcement
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation and schema definition

## Options Considered

### Frontend Framework Options

#### Option 1: React + Next.js (Selected)
- **Pros**: 
  - Excellent TypeScript integration
  - Large ecosystem and community
  - SSR/SSG capabilities
  - Proven scalability
  - Team expertise
- **Cons**: 
  - Larger bundle size than some alternatives
  - Complexity for simple use cases

#### Option 2: Vue.js + Nuxt
- **Pros**: 
  - Simpler learning curve
  - Good TypeScript support
  - Smaller bundle size
- **Cons**: 
  - Smaller ecosystem
  - Less team expertise
  - Fewer AI/enterprise focused libraries

#### Option 3: Svelte + SvelteKit
- **Pros**: 
  - Excellent performance
  - Smaller bundle size
  - Modern reactive paradigm
- **Cons**: 
  - Smaller ecosystem
  - Limited enterprise adoption
  - No team expertise

### API Layer Options

#### Option 1: tRPC v11 (Selected)
- **Pros**: 
  - End-to-end type safety
  - Excellent developer experience
  - No code generation required
  - Built-in validation
  - Growing ecosystem
- **Cons**: 
  - Newer technology (less mature)
  - TypeScript-only ecosystem
  - Learning curve for team

#### Option 2: GraphQL + TypeScript
- **Pros**: 
  - Mature ecosystem
  - Powerful query capabilities
  - Industry standard
- **Cons**: 
  - Complex setup and tooling
  - Code generation complexity
  - Overfetching prevention complexity

#### Option 3: REST APIs + OpenAPI
- **Pros**: 
  - Industry standard
  - Wide tooling support
  - Team familiarity
- **Cons**: 
  - No automatic type safety
  - Manual API documentation
  - Code generation complexity

### Database Options

#### Option 1: MySQL (Selected)
- **Pros**: 
  - Proven reliability and performance
  - Excellent ecosystem support
  - Team expertise
  - Strong ACID compliance
  - Good scaling options
- **Cons**: 
  - Traditional RDBMS limitations
  - Requires careful schema design

#### Option 2: PostgreSQL
- **Pros**: 
  - Advanced features (JSON, arrays)
  - Excellent performance
  - Strong ecosystem
- **Cons**: 
  - Less team expertise
  - More complex for simple use cases

#### Option 3: MongoDB
- **Pros**: 
  - Flexible schema
  - Good for rapid prototyping
  - JSON-native
- **Cons**: 
  - Eventual consistency challenges
  - Less structured data guarantees
  - Not ideal for financial/critical data

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to frontend
- **Developer Experience**: Excellent tooling and developer productivity
- **Performance**: Modern stack with excellent performance characteristics
- **Ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem with growing community support
- **Team Productivity**: Reduced context switching with unified TypeScript stack
- **Scalability**: Stack proven at scale by major companies

### Negative
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn tRPC and modern React patterns
- **Ecosystem Maturity**: Some tools (tRPC) are newer with smaller communities
- **Complexity**: Modern stack complexity vs simpler alternatives
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Some dependency on specific tool ecosystems

### Neutral
- **Bundle Size**: Larger than minimal frameworks but acceptable for enterprise use
- **Deployment**: Standard containerized deployment patterns
- **Database Migration**: Potential future migration complexity with ORM abstractions

## Implementation

### Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Completed): Core stack setup and initial development patterns
- **Phase 2** (In Progress): Team training and best practices establishment
- **Phase 3** (Ongoing): Performance optimization and scaling

### Success Criteria
- All new features built with the selected stack
- Type safety coverage > 95%
- Developer productivity metrics improved
- Performance requirements met
- Team satisfaction with development experience

### Rollback Plan
- Gradual migration possible due to modular architecture
- Database layer abstracted through ORM
- API layer can be gradually migrated
- Frontend components can be incrementally updated

## Monitoring and Review

### Metrics
- Development velocity (features per sprint)
- Bug rate in production
- Type safety coverage
- Bundle size and performance metrics
- Developer satisfaction scores

### Review Schedule
- **Quarterly**: Performance and metric review
- **Annually**: Major technology version updates and alternatives evaluation
- **Next Review**: 2026-01-12
