## üìã Claude Code Specific Behaviors

### VibeCoding Workflow Optimization

**Strengths to Leverage**:
- **Deep Reasoning**: Claude Code excels at understanding complex architectural decisions
- **Context Assembly**: Superior ability to combine multiple documentation sources
- **Pattern Recognition**: Excellent at identifying and following existing code patterns
- **Natural Language Processing**: Outstanding at interpreting requirements and documentation

**Recommended Approach**:
```markdown
1. **Context Loading Phase**: 
   - Start with @docs/README.md for project overview
   - Load relevant architecture documentation
   - Review specific implementation patterns
   
2. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Use reasoning capabilities to understand requirements
   - Identify existing patterns in codebase
   - Plan implementation approach
   
3. **Implementation Phase**:
   - Use appropriate tools (Edit/MultiEdit/Write)
   - Follow Kodix architectural patterns
   - Implement with comprehensive error handling
   
4. **Validation Phase**:
   - Run tests and quality checks
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Ensure architectural consistency
```

### Tool Usage Optimization

**File Operations**:
- **Edit Tool**: Use for single, targeted changes with sufficient context
- **MultiEdit Tool**: Use for multiple related changes in one file
- **Write Tool**: Use for new file creation or major restructuring
- **Read Tool**: Use extensively for understanding existing code patterns

**Context Management**:
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Load general context first, then specific details
- **Documentation First**: Always read relevant docs before implementation
- **Pattern Discovery**: Use Glob/Grep to understand existing conventions

### Context Engineering Excellence

**Documentation Integration**:
- Always reference universal rules first: `@docs/rules/universal-ai-rules.md`
- Load Claude-specific rules: `@docs/rules/claude-rules.md`
- Use context engineering principles from `@docs/context-engineering/README.md`

**Semantic Understanding**:
- Leverage natural language comprehension for complex requirements
- Use reasoning capabilities to understand architectural decisions
- Apply logical deduction for problem-solving approaches

## üîß Context-Specific Syncing Advice

### Optimal Context Assembly

**Priority Order for Claude Code**:
1. **Universal Rules** - Foundation for all behavior
2. **Architecture Documentation** - System understanding
3. **Specific Implementation** - Detailed patterns
4. **Testing & Validation** - Quality assurance

**Context Window Management**:
- Use progressive disclosure to manage information complexity
- Load most relevant documentation first
- Apply semantic understanding to prioritize important information
- Reference related documentation through cross-links

### Rule Synchronization Strategy

**Sync Requirements for Claude Code**:
- **Universal Rules**: Full content from `docs/rules/universal-ai-rules.md`
- **Claude-Specific Rules**: Complete content from `docs/rules/claude-rules.md`
- **No Cross-Contamination**: Ensure no Cursor or Gemini-specific content
- **Context Engineering**: Maintain VibeCoding patterns throughout

**Quality Validation**:
- Verify VibeCoding workflow patterns are clear
- Ensure context engineering principles are applied
- Validate tool usage patterns are comprehensive
- Check that universal rule integration is seamless
