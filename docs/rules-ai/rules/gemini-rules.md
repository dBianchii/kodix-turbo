## ðŸ’¡ Tool Usage

- **`search_file_content`**: Use to find specific content within files.
- **`glob`**: Use to find files matching a pattern.

## File Operations

- For small, targeted changes, prefer `replace` over `write_file`.
- When using `replace`, always read the file first to get the exact `old_string`.
- For creating new files or making large changes, use `write_file`.

---

## Shell Commands

- Use `run_shell_command` to execute project scripts like `pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, etc.
- Be cautious with commands that modify the file system.

---

## PRP Workflow

- Use `read_file` to read the PRP document.
- Use the available tools to implement the requirements.
- Refer to the universal rules for the PRP process.
