# New AI Assistant Integration Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Summary

This document provides the standard procedure for integrating a new, previously unsupported AI assistant with the Kodix repository's universal rules and documentation system.

## ðŸ“‹ Universal Setup Pattern

Every AI assistant integration follows this standard pattern. The goal is to leverage our universal documentation with minimal tool-specific configuration.

## ðŸš€ How to Integrate a New Assistant

### Step 1: Identify the Assistant's Rules File

First, determine where the new assistant looks for its system prompt or context rules. This might be a specific file in a `.config` directory, a file in the project root, or a setting within the tool itself.

- **Cursor**: Uses `.cursor/rules/README.md`.
- **Gemini CLI**: Can use a `GEMINI.md` file at the project root.
- **Claude Code**: Can use `docs/CLAUDE.md`.

### Step 2: Manually Sync the Universal Rules

Our core principle is to have a **single source of truth for rules**. You must manually synchronize the rules from this source file to the assistant's specific configuration file.

For a detailed, step-by-step guide on this procedure, refer to the official documentation:

- **[Manually Synchronizing AI Assistant Rules](./sync-rules-manually.md)**

This is a critical step to ensure the new assistant operates under the same guidelines as all others.

### Step 3: Create Tool-Specific Documentation

Create a new directory for the assistant under `docs/ai-assistants/[tool-name]/`. Inside, create a `README.md` file using the template below.

#### Configuration Template

# [AI Assistant Name] Setup for Kodix

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Summary

Step-by-step setup guide for integrating [AI Assistant Name] with the Kodix monorepo.

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites

- [List any necessary installations or accounts]

## ðŸš€ Installation and Setup Steps

1.  **Install the Tool**:
    ```bash
    # Command to install the tool
    ```
2.  **Configure Authentication**:
    ```bash
    # Steps for API keys or login
    ```
3.  **Initialize in Kodix**:
    ```bash
    # Any init commands to run in the project root
    ```

## ðŸ”§ [AI Assistant Name]-Specific Configuration

- Document **only the unique features or configuration needs** of this assistant here.
- For example, if it uses a unique file name for rules or has a special permissions system.

- **[New Assistant Integration Guide](./new-assistant-integration.md)** - The guide you are reading now.

### Step 4: Validate the Integration

Use the **[Validation Checklist](./VALIDATION-CHECKLIST.md)** to ensure the new assistant is correctly loading and interpreting the project's rules and context.

## ðŸš¨ What to Avoid

- **Do not duplicate universal principles**. The tool-specific documentation should only contain information that is unique to that tool.
- **Do not create separate rule files** in `docs/rules/`. All rules are in `docs/rules/README.md`.
- **Always prefer referencing universal docs** over creating new, tool-specific versions.
