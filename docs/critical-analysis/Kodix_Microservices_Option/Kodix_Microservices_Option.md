# Independent Micro-Services & Repo-Per-Domain  
*(An Alternative to the Single-Repo, Multi-Tenant Kodix Stack)*

## 1  Executive Summary

Instead of one monolithic codebase that embeds every product and feature,
**split the platform into narrowly scoped services**—each with its own source
repository, pipeline, and datastore. Typical domains might include:

| Core Domain | Typical Responsibilities |
|-------------|--------------------------|
| **Auth & Identity** | Sign-up / login, SSO, MFA, password resets, token introspection |
| **Billing / Payments** | Subscription tiers, usage metering, invoices, webhooks from PSPs |
| **Messaging / Notifications** | Email, SMS, in-app alerts, digest schedules |
| **Agent-Runtime (AI)** | Chat completion, model orchestration, vector search, rate limiting |
| **Content Library** | File upload, semantic indexing, versioning |
| **Analytics / Reporting** | Event ingestion, dashboard queries, retention cohorts |

> **Rule of Thumb:** *A service owns a single bounded context, deploys
independently, and exposes interaction exclusively via a network API.*

---

## 2  Technical Rationale

### 2.1  Data Isolation by Default  
*   Each service maintains **its own database instance**—no shared tables, no
    cross-schema joins. Isolation is achieved structurally rather than by
    application-level filters.  
*   Security scope boils down to *“Can this credential reach the service?”*
    instead of per-query `(team_id, app_id)` enforcement.

### 2.2  Focused Codebases  
*   Repositories remain <10–20 kLOC, easing onboarding and PR reviews.  
*   Dependency graphs shrink; test suites run faster.  
*   Language/runtime upgrades can occur piecemeal (e.g., migrate AI-runtime to
    Deno without touching Billing).

### 2.3  Independent Scaling Paths  
*   Spiky workloads (chat completions, bulk exports) scale horizontally without
    over-provisioning quieter subsystems (Auth).  
*   Cost attribution per domain becomes trivial with service-level metering.

### 2.4  Release Cadence & Blast Radius  
*   A bug in Billing cannot take down Chat.  
*   Hotfixes ship in minutes to the affected service; no need to cut a platform-wide release.

## 3  Trade-Offs & Complexity Budget

| Dimension | Upside | Downside / Mitigation |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------|
| **Operational Overhead** | Tailored infra per service | CI/CD, observability, on-call pager expand; adopt *platform engineering* tooling (Backstage, Terraform modules) |
| **Data Consistency** | Clear ownership, isolated writes | Cross-service transactions require **sagas** or **outbox/event sourcing**; embrace **eventual consistency** where UX allows |
| **Latency** | Local calls stay fast, heavy logic extracted | N → N network hops; use **API gateways** + **gRPC/HTTP2** + **connection pooling** |
| **Governance** | Strong domain boundaries, explicit APIs | Versioning & deprecation policy needed; employ **contract tests** / **OpenAPI** |
| **Developer Experience** | Smaller mental model | Service discovery, env setup more involved; toolbox scripts + `devcontainer.json` help |

## 4  Suggested Service Blueprint

| Service | Datastore | Interface | CI/CD | Owner |
|---------|-----------|-----------|-------|-------|
| `auth-service` | PostgreSQL (RLS) | REST + JWT | GitHub → Docker → Kubernetes | Platform Team |
| `billing-service` | MySQL (ACID) | gRPC + Webhooks | GitHub → Docker → Kubernetes | FinOps Team |
| `notification-service` | DynamoDB | REST + SNS/SQS | GitHub → Lambda | Messaging Guild |
| `ai-runtime-service` | Postgres + Qdrant | tRPC | GitHub → Docker → Kubernetes | AI Guild |
| `library-service` | S3 + Postgres | REST | GitHub → Docker → Kubernetes | Content Team |
| `analytics-service` | ClickHouse | HTTP + Kafka | GitHub → Docker → Kubernetes | Data Team |

## 5  Migration Path from Monolith

1. **Strangle the Monolith**  
   *Wrap existing endpoints with a façade, routing new traffic to the first
   extracted service (e.g., Auth).*
2. **Extract Shared Libraries**  
   Convert in-process modules (payments, notifications) into gRPC or REST
   adapters living in their own repos.
3. **Adopt an Event Backbone**  
   Introduce Kafka/NATS; emit domain events from the monolith, consume in
   emerging services.
4. **Incremental Decomposition**  
   Retire code paths in the monolith once coverage by new services is ≥ 95 %.
5. **Decommission & Archive**  
   Freeze the monolith repo; keep only shared proto/OpenAPI contracts.

## 6  Cost & Resource Estimate

| Item | Initial Effort | Ongoing |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Infra automation (Terraform, Helm)** | 4–6 weeks | Minor |
| **Observability stack (Prometheus, Loki, Grafana)** | 2 weeks | +1 FTE SRE |
| **Cross-service SDK / contracts** | 3 weeks | Maintainers in each team |
| **DevEx tooling (`make dev`, unified local stack)** | 2 weeks | Continuous |

## 7  Open Questions

* **How many internal “startups” justify the added operational load?**  
* **Is the organization ready for service-level SLOs and on-call rotations?**  
* **Will the product road-map tolerate the latency introduced by
  asynchronous, event-driven flows?**  
* **Should certain high-throughput domains (chat streaming) remain co-located
  to minimize hops?**

---

## 8  Recommendation

Proceed with a **pilot extraction**—migrate the *Notification* module into its own
service and quantify:

* Deployment frequency  
* Incident rate & MTTR  
* Latency impact on end-to-end chat flow  
* Developer satisfaction (survey after 4 weeks)

The metrics will reveal whether the micro-service model yields net benefit
versus the current single-repo approach.
