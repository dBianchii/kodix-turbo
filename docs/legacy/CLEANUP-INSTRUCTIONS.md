# 🗂️ Legacy Documentation Cleanup – Manual Review Instructions

This folder stores deprecated or obsolete documents that may still contain useful knowledge.

Whenever you decide to review and clean up the legacy folder, follow this simple process:

---

## 🧾 Legacy Cleanup Steps (for each file):

1. Open and read the document in `docs/legacy`
2. Check for any valuable insights or technical details
3. If useful:
   - Copy or migrate the content to a proper location in `/docs`
     (e.g., architecture, context-engineering, documentation-standards, etc.)
4. If fully migrated or no longer useful:
   - Delete the legacy file

## 🧠 Tip:
You don't need to perform this automatically. Run this process manually only when asked to clean or when legacy files are reviewed during documentation improvements.
