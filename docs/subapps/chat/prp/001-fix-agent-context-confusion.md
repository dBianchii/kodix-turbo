## 🎯 Goal

Eliminate context confusion when switching between AI agents during chat conversations by implementing proper agent switch detection and context isolation mechanisms.

## 📋 Context

### Problem Statement

The Kodix chat platform experiences context confusion when users switch between AI agents (Claude, Gemini, GPT) mid-conversation. This manifests as:

- Residual context from previous agents leaking into new ones
- Incorrect responses based on previous agent's memory and assumptions
- Conflicting rule interpretation between different agent personalities
- Assistant-specific behavior persisting inappropriately across agent switches

### Root Cause Analysis

**Architecture-Implementation Gap**: The sophisticated agent switching framework exists in documentation (`docs/subapps/chat/backend/agent-switching-architecture.md`) but the core `detectAgentSwitch()` method is missing from the actual `AiStudioService` implementation. This creates a disconnect between documented capabilities and actual behavior.

### Business Impact

- **User Experience Degradation**: Confusing and inconsistent assistant responses
- **Trust Issues**: Users lose confidence in the AI system reliability  
- **Support Overhead**: Increased confusion-related support tickets
- **Feature Adoption**: Users avoid multi-agent workflows due to unreliability

## 👥 Users

### Primary Users
- **Chat Users**: All users engaging with multiple AI agents in conversations
- **Power Users**: Users who frequently switch between agents for different use cases
- **Team Collaborators**: Users sharing sessions with agent switches

### Use Cases
- **Workflow Optimization**: Switching from creative agent to analytical agent
- **Expertise Matching**: Moving from general assistant to specialized agent
- **Conversation Recovery**: Switching agents when current one is not performing well
- **Multi-perspective Analysis**: Getting different viewpoints on the same topic

### Expected Frequency
- **High Frequency**: 30-40% of chat sessions involve agent switches
- **Critical Path**: Agent switching is a core differentiating feature

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] User can switch agents mid-conversation without context leakage
- [ ] System accurately detects when agent switches occur (>99% accuracy)

- [ ] Session state remains consistent across agent switches
- [ ] Agent history is properly tracked and maintained
- [ ] System handles concurrent agent switches gracefully
- [ ] Error scenarios are handled with proper fallbacks

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Agent switch detection completes in <50ms average response time
- [ ] Context isolation achieves 100% separation between agents
- [ ] Database fields (`aiAgentId`, `activeAgentId`, `agentHistory`) remain synchronized
- [ ] Session validation prevents corrupted states
- [ ] Comprehensive logging for debugging context issues

### Quality Requirements
- [ ] **ESLint compliance** (all rules followed)

- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (screen reader support for agent indicators)
- [ ] Mobile responsive design maintained
- [ ] i18n support (no hardcoded strings)
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained (no regression in message response time)

## 🏗️ Technical Specification

### Architecture

**SubApp Isolation**: This feature spans Chat and AI Studio SubApps with proper service layer communication:

- **Chat SubApp**: Manages session state, agent switching UI, and user interactions
- **AI Studio SubApp**: Handles agent detection, prompt generation, and context isolation
- **Service Layer Communication**: Chat service calls AI Studio service for detection and prompt building
- **Multi-tenancy**: All operations respect teamId isolation boundaries

**Data Contracts & Boundaries Compliance**:
- Chat service owns session state management
- AI Studio service owns agent behavior and prompt generation  
- Cross-service communication via well-defined interfaces
- No direct database access across service boundaries

### Components

**Frontend Components:**

- `AgentSwitchIndicator`: Visual feedback for agent switches in chat interface
- `AgentValidationAlert`: User notification for context issues (if any)
- Enhanced `ChatThreadProvider`: Integration of agent switch detection
- Uses existing Shadcn/ui components for consistency
- **ESLint compliant** (useTRPC pattern for all API calls)

**Backend Components:**

- `AgentSwitchDetector`: Core detection logic in AI Studio service
- `ContextIsolationManager`: Handles prompt building and context separation
- `SessionStateValidator`: Ensures consistency across agent switches
- Enhanced `ChatService.switchAgent()`: Improved agent switching with validation
- **Service layer** communication between Chat and AI Studio

**Database Components:**

- **No schema changes required** (existing fields sufficient)
- Enhanced validation for `agentHistory` JSON field integrity
- **Type-safe** operations using existing Drizzle patterns
- Improved indexing on agent-related fields for performance

### Data Flow

1. User initiates agent switch via UI component
2. Frontend sends switch request via tRPC (**useTRPC pattern**)
3. `ChatService.switchAgent()` validates request and updates session
4. Next message triggers `AiStudioService.getSystemPrompt()`
5. `detectAgentSwitch()` analyzes session state and history
6. If switch detected, `buildAgentSwitchPrompt()` creates isolation prompt
7. AI model receives context-isolated prompt with agent instructions
8. Response maintains new agent personality without previous context

### Kodix Stack Integration

- Router: `chat.switchAgent` (existing, enhanced)
- New Router: `chat.validateSession` for state validation

**Drizzle ORM:**

- Existing schema in `packages/db/schema/apps/chat.ts`
- Type-safe queries for session and agent operations
- Repository pattern maintained for data access
- No migrations required

**UI (Shadcn/ui + Tailwind):**
