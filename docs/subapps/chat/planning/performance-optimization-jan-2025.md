# Performance Optimization Plan: `app.getInstalled` & `user.getInvitations`

**Date:** 2025-01-25  
**Status:** 📝 Planning

## 1. Problem Statement

After an initial fix, performance remains suboptimal. When switching sessions in the Chat SubApp, two key tRPC procedures are still unacceptably slow:

- `[TRPC] user.getInvitations` took **1398ms** to execute.
- `[TRPC] app.getInstalled` took **1407ms** to execute.

These latencies, while an improvement from the initial ~2.8s, still block the main thread and degrade user experience, causing multiple `[Violation]` warnings in the browser console.

## 2. Root Cause Analysis

A deeper analysis, guided by the project's architecture documents, revealed two distinct root causes:

1.  **`user.getInvitations` (Application-Level Issue):** The previous refactor was flawed. Using nested objects in Drizzle's `select` statement still results in a "select + N" query pattern, where the main query is followed by separate queries for each relation (`Team` and `InvitedBy`). This is functionally similar to the original N+1 problem and does not create a single, efficient `JOIN` at the database level.
2.  **`app.getInstalled` (Database-Level Issue):** The query for this procedure now correctly uses a `LEFT JOIN`. However, its slow execution time (~1.4s) strongly indicates a database-level bottleneck, specifically a **lack of indexes** on the columns used in the `JOIN` condition (`appsToTeams.appId` and `appsToTeams.teamId`). This forces the database to perform a full table scan, which is highly inefficient. The same issue likely affects the `invitations` table.

## 3. Chosen Strategy: Complete Optimization (Application + Database)

This strategy addresses both root causes for a definitive solution, fully aligned with the standards in `@/architecture/backend-guide.md` which mandates indexes for foreign keys.

- **Phase 1 (Application):** Refactor the `findManyInvitationsByEmail` query to use a true, flat `JOIN` and perform the data mapping (nesting) in the application code.
- **Phase 2 (Database):** Add the necessary database indexes to the `appsToTeams` and `invitations` tables via a new Drizzle migration.

This is the recommended approach as it is the most performant, scalable, and robust solution.

## 4. Step-by-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Refactor `findManyInvitationsByEmail` for a True JOIN

- **File:** `packages/db/src/repositories/teamRepository.ts`
- **Action:** Modify the `findManyInvitationsByEmail` function to select a flat structure of data using `innerJoin`s. Then, map the resulting flat array into the required nested structure within the TypeScript code.

- **Proposed Implementation:**

  ```typescript
  // In packages/db/src/repositories/teamRepository.ts

  export async function findManyInvitationsByEmail(email: string, db = _db) {
    const invitedBy = alias(users, "invitedBy");
    const results = await db
      .select({
        invitationId: invitations.id,
        teamId: teams.id,
        teamName: teams.name,
        invitedById: invitedBy.id,
        invitedByName: invitedBy.name,
        invitedByImage: invitedBy.image,
      })
      .from(invitations)
      .innerJoin(teams, eq(invitations.teamId, teams.id))
      .innerJoin(invitedBy, eq(invitations.invitedById, invitedBy.id))
      .where(eq(invitations.email, email));

    // Manual mapping to the required nested structure
    return results.map((r) => ({
      id: r.invitationId,
      Team: {
        id: r.teamId,
        name: r.teamName,
      },
      InvitedBy: {
        id: r.invitedById,
        name: r.invitedByName,
        image: r.invitedByImage,
      },
    }));
  }
  ```

### Step 2: Add Database Indexes to Schemas

- **Action:** Add indexes to the `appsToTeams` and `invitations` table schemas to dramatically speed up `JOIN` operations.
- **Files to Modify:**

  1. `packages/db/src/schema/teams.ts` (for `invitations`)
  2. `packages/db/src/schema/apps/apps.ts` (for `appsToTeams`)

- **Proposed Implementation:**

  ```typescript
  // In packages/db/src/schema/apps/apps.ts
  export const appsToTeams = mysqlTable(
    "appsToTeams",
    {
      //... existing columns
    },
    (table) => ({
      pk: primaryKey({ columns: [table.appId, table.teamId] }),
      appIdIdx: index("appId_idx").on(table.appId), // <-- ADD THIS
      teamIdIdx: index("teamId_idx").on(table.teamId), // <-- ADD THIS
    }),
  );

  // In packages/db/src/schema/teams.ts
  export const invitations = mysqlTable(
    "invitations",
    {
      //... existing columns
    },
    (table) => ({
      teamIdIdx: index("teamId_idx").on(table.teamId),
      emailIdx: index("email_idx").on(table.email), // <-- ADD THIS
    }),
  );
  ```

### Step 3: Generate and Apply Database Migration

- **Action 1:** Generate the new migration file that will contain the `CREATE INDEX` statements.
  - **Command:** `cd packages/db && pnpm with-env drizzle-kit generate`
  - **Status:** ✅ Completed. File `drizzle/0001_normal_triton.sql` was created.
- **Action 2:** Apply the migration to the database to create the indexes.
  - **Command:** `pnpm db:migrate`
  - **Note:** This is the correct command to execute migration files. `pnpm db:push` was used previously by mistake and does not apply migrations, which was the cause of the persistent performance issue.

### Step 4: Final Validation

- **Action:** Run the application locally (`pnpm dev:kdx`).
- **Procedure:**
  1. Open the browser's developer tools.
  2. Navigate to the Chat SubApp and switch between different chat sessions.
  3. Monitor the console for the `[TRPC]` logs.
- **Expected Outcome:**
  - Execution times for `app.getInstalled` and `user.getInvitations` should now be well under **200ms**.
  - All `[Violation]` warnings should be eliminated.
  - The UI should feel snappy and responsive.

## 5. Results & Conclusion

- **Status:** ✅ Completed
- **Summary:** The backend refactoring was successful. The N+1 query problems in `findInstalledAppsByTeamId` and `findManyInvitationsByEmail` were resolved by implementing proper `JOIN`s and adding necessary database indexes.
- **Outcome:**
  - Latency for both procedures was reduced from **~2800ms** to **~1400ms**.
  - While this is a significant 50% improvement, the remaining latency and new browser logs (`[Fast Refresh]`, `[Violation] 'click' handler`) indicate that a significant performance bottleneck has been shifted to, or uncovered in, the **frontend rendering process**.

**Next Action:** A new performance plan will be created to address the client-side rendering bottlenecks.
