# Frontend Performance Optimization Plan - Chat SubApp

**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Partially Completed

## 1. Problem Statement & Lessons Learned

Following successful backend optimizations, the Chat SubApp still exhibits significant client-side performance issues, causing `[Violation]` warnings in the browser console. The initial attempt to fix this with `React.memo` was insufficient because the `props` (especially callback functions) passed to the memoized components were being recreated on every render.

- **Key Architectural Guideline:** The project's documentation, specifically `@docs/subapps/chat/planning/architectural-correction-antipatterns.md`, dictates a critical principle: **"Corrections should be surgical, not architectural."**

## 2. Chosen Strategy: Surgical Frontend Optimization

A targeted, low-risk optimization strategy was chosen to align with the project's architecture.

- **Phase 1: Stabilize Props with `useCallback`**: **âœ… COMPLETED.** This was the highest priority. All relevant callback functions were wrapped in `useCallback` to ensure they have a stable identity, making `React.memo` effective.
- **Phase 2: Implement Optimistic Updates**: **âœ… COMPLETED.** Costly `queryClient.invalidateQueries` calls were replaced with `queryClient.setQueryData` for session updates, providing instant UI feedback for the sidebar.

## 3. Results & Next Steps

- **Outcome:** The primary functional bug where a component (`DialogDescription`) was causing a runtime error has been **resolved**. The UI is now stable and functional.
- **Remaining Issue:** While the application works, the `[Violation]` warnings persist. This indicates that even with memoization and optimistic updates, the component tree's rendering process is still heavy enough to block the main thread during interactions.

### Final Optimization Step (Pending)

The final step to eliminate the remaining performance warnings is to refactor the `UnifiedChatPage` to centralize its complex state and data-fetching logic into a dedicated hook (`useUnifiedChatState`). This will simplify the main component, reduce its re-render scope, and fully align it with the "CentralizaÃ§Ã£o de LÃ³gica de Dados" pattern described in `@chat-architecture.md`. This action was deferred to first resolve the critical runtime errors.

---

**Next Action:** Proceed with creating and implementing the `useUnifiedChatState` hook to finalize performance optimization.
