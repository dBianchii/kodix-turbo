# 🧠 Chat Context Engineering

> This section details the application of **Context Engineering** principles within the Kodix Chat SubApp. It serves as the central hub for understanding how we design the AI's informational environment to enable complex, reliable, and autonomous behavior.

---

## 🎯 Core Objective

Our goal is to move beyond simple prompt-and-response and build a rich, dynamic ecosystem of information that sets the AI up for success. This aligns with the principles laid out in the main [**Context Engineering Guide**](../../../context-engineering/README.md).

## 📚 Index of Strategies

This section is organized around the key pillars of Context Engineering. Each document outlines the current implementation and future architectural vision for the Chat SubApp.

1.  **[📜 Prompting Strategy](./prompt-strategy.md)**

    - **Focus**: How we construct the AI's core instructions.
    - **Covers**: System Prompt Hierarchy, Agent "Hard Reset" mechanism, and dynamic instruction injection.

2.  **[🧠 Memory Strategy](./memory-strategy.md)**

    - **Focus**: How the AI remembers and learns from interactions.
    - **Covers**: Short-term conversation history, long-term memory summarization, and user-specific memory.

3.  **[📚 Knowledge Base (RAG) Strategy](./knowledge-base-strategy.md)**

    - **Focus**: How we ground the AI in factual, external data.
    - **Covers**: Architecture for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide access to internal documentation and other verified sources.

4.  **[🛠️ Tooling Strategy](./tooling-strategy.md)**
    - **Focus**: How we empower the AI to perform actions.
    - **Covers**: Framework for providing the AI with tools to interact with the Kodix ecosystem (e.g., code search, file access, API calls).
