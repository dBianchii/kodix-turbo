## üéØ Quick Summary

Context Engineering is the evolution of prompt engineering - a discipline for designing and managing the entire informational ecosystem in which AI agents operate, moving from static prompts to dynamic, stateful systems.

## üìã Overview

**Context Engineering** represents a paradigm shift in how we interact with AI systems. Rather than crafting single, static prompts, we orchestrate a dynamic ecosystem that provides AI with the right information and tools at the right time.

Our goal is to **set the AI up for success**. Most failures in agentic systems stem not from flawed models, but from incomplete or poorly constructed context.

### Evolution from Prompt Engineering

| Principle | Prompt Engineering (Static)     | Context Engineering (Dynamic)                |
| :-------- | :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------- |
| **Scope** | A single input (the prompt).    | The entire system of inputs.                 |
| **State** | Stateless.                      | Stateful, with memory and history.           |
| **Data**  | Included in the prompt.         | Retrieved dynamically from external sources. |
| **Goal**  | Get a good output for one task. | Build a reliable, autonomous agent.          |

## üöÄ Kodix Context Engineering Initiative

<!-- AI-CONTEXT: Strategic Documentation Upgrade -->

### Current Status

We are actively upgrading our documentation to follow structured context engineering principles. This initiative will transform our documentation from traditional human-centric content to a dual-purpose system serving both humans and AI tools effectively.

### Key Resources

- **[üåç Universal Compatibility Principle](./universal-compatibility-principle.md)** - Core principle for cross-AI assistant compatibility
- **[üìä Strategic Upgrade Plan](./planning/kodix-documentation-upgrade-plan.md)** - Comprehensive roadmap for context engineering implementation
- **[üìù Documentation Standards](./standards/)** - Patterns and guidelines for context-aware documentation
  - [Documentation Patterns](./standards/documentation-patterns.md) - Core patterns for all documentation
- **[üöÄ PRP Workflow Implementation](./planning/prp-workflow-implementation.md)** - Quick win: Structured development with `/generate-prp` and `/execute-prp` commands

### Quick Win: PRP Workflow ‚úÖ

We've successfully implemented a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) workflow as an immediate improvement to our development process:

- **`/generate-prp`**: Transforms feature requests into detailed specifications
- **`/execute-prp`**: Executes PRPs with automated testing and quality checks
- **[üìö PRP Guide](./prp/README.md)**: Complete guide on using the PRP workflow
- **[üìù Example](./prp/INITIAL-example.md)**: Sample feature request format
- **[ü§ñ Universal Commands](./commands/)**: Tool-agnostic command instructions

This provides a structured approach to development while we build out the full context engineering system. The commands work universally across all AI assistants!

## üèóÔ∏è The Anatomy of Context

A well-engineered context is composed of several layers. These components are the building blocks we use to construct the AI's "working memory" for any given task.

```mermaid

    subgraph "The Context Ecosystem"
        direction LR
        subgraph "Static Foundations"
            direction TB
            A["Instructions & Rules"];
            B["User Profile"];
        end
        subgraph "Dynamic Inputs"
            direction TB
            C["Memory & History"];
            D["Knowledge Base (RAG)"];
            E["Tools & APIs"];
        end
    end

    A --> F{LLM};
    B --> F;
    C --> F;
    D --> F;
    E --> F;

    style A fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#f9f9f9,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

```

**Note on Instructions & Rules:** The Kodix project enforces **[Priority Policies](../rules/PRIORITY-POLICIES.md)** as the highest-level rules that must be loaded first by all AI assistants. These policies override all other instructions and establish critical development standards.

## üîÑ Key Strategies for Context Management

Managing what goes into the context window is the primary job of an AI engineer. We group our management strategies into four categories, based on the lifecycle of information.

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Context Management Lifecycle"
        A(Write) --> B(Select);
        B --> C(Compress);
        C --> D(Isolate);
    end

    style A fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#005c99,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#005c99,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#005c99,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#cce5ff,stroke:#005c99,stroke-width:2px
```

- **Write:** Persisting context outside the context window (e.g., to a scratchpad or memory).
- **Select:** Strategically pulling relevant information _into_ the context window when needed.
- **Compress:** Summarizing or trimming context to preserve tokens and reduce noise.
- **Isolate:** Separating context across different agents or environments to manage complexity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges and Considerations

A large context is not always a better context. Poorly managed context can lead to specific, identifiable problems.

- **Context Poisoning:** Hallucinations or errors are saved and pollute future interactions.
- **Context Distraction:** The model is overwhelmed by irrelevant information.
- **Context Confusion:** Superfluous information influences the output incorrectly.
- **Context Clash:** Contradictory pieces of information exist within the context.

## üí° Practical Workflow: The PRP Method

Beyond the core concepts, we have a standardized, practical workflow for applying these principles to complex development tasks. This method, called the **Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)**, structures the interaction with an AI agent into distinct "planning" and "execution" phases.
