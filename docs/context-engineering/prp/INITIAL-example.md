# INITIAL Feature Request Example

## FEATURE:

Add a dark mode toggle to the Kodix settings page that allows users to switch between light and dark themes. The toggle should persist the user's preference across sessions and apply the theme system-wide. The implementation should follow Kodix's design system and work seamlessly with all existing components.

## CONTEXT:

Users have been requesting a dark mode option to reduce eye strain during extended coding sessions, especially when working late hours. Many competing platforms already offer this feature, and it has become a standard expectation in modern web applications. The implementation needs to integrate with our existing Tailwind CSS setup and respect the user's system preferences as the default.

## USERS:

- **Primary**: All Kodix users who prefer dark interfaces
- **Secondary**: Users with light sensitivity or visual accessibility needs
- **Use Cases**:
  - Working in low-light environments
  - Reducing eye strain during long sessions
  - Personal preference for dark interfaces
  - Accessibility requirements

## STACK:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 App Router, React Server Components where applicable
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theme colors
- **State Management**: Zustand for theme state persistence
- **Storage**: localStorage for client-side preference, database for user preference sync
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui components with theme support

## EXAMPLES:

Look at the existing theme implementation in:

- `packages/ui/src/theme-provider.tsx` - Current theme setup
- `apps/kdx/src/components/settings/` - Settings page structure
- `packages/ui/globals.css` - CSS variable definitions

## DOCUMENTATION:

- Tailwind CSS Dark Mode: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode
- Shadcn/ui Theming: https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/theming
- Next.js App Router: https://nextjs.org/docs/app
- Zustand Persist: https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#persist-middleware

## OTHER CONSIDERATIONS:

- **System Preference**: Should detect and respect OS-level dark mode preference as default
- **Flash Prevention**: Implement proper SSR/hydration to prevent theme flashing on page load
- **Animation**: Smooth transition between themes without jarring changes
- **Component Compatibility**: All existing UI components must support both themes
- **Performance**: Theme switching should be instant with no page reload
- **Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast ratios in both themes
- **Mobile Support**: Toggle should work well on mobile devices
