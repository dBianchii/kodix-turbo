# Generate PRP Command

When the user types `/generate-prp` followed by feature details, file path, or structured input:

## üö® **Mandatory Formatting Rules**

### 1. **Language Requirement: English Only**

- **ALL PRPs MUST be written exclusively in English**
- This ensures consistency, portability between AI assistants, and compatibility with global tools
- No exceptions - all sections, comments, and content must be in English

### 2. **Sequential Naming Convention**

- **ALL PRP files MUST follow sequential numbering within their folder**
- When saving a new PRP in any subfolder (e.g., `/docs/planning/model-sync/`), the filename must follow the existing numerical sequence
- **Format**: `XXX-[prp-name].md` where XXX is the next sequential number
- **Example**:
  - Current document: `023-change-something.md`
  - Next document: `024-new-feature-name.md`
- This numbering facilitates ordering, change history tracking, and traceability

## Step 1: Parse Input

Extract feature information from the user's input. Accept these formats:

1. **Direct input after command**:

   ```
   /generate-prp Add dark mode toggle to settings
   ```

2. **Reference to file**:

   ```
   /generate-prp INITIAL.md
   ```

3. **Structured format**:
   ```
   /generate-prp
   Feature: Dark mode toggle
   Context: Users need theme switching
   Users: All Kodix users
   Stack: Next.js, Tailwind, Zustand
   ```

## Step 2: **VALIDATION PHASE** üö®

### 2.1 **Evaluate Current Code Alignment**

**CRITICAL**: Before generating any plan, verify alignment with existing codebase:

```
- Search for similar existing implementations
- Check if requested feature already exists (partially or fully)
- Verify the feature fits within current architecture
- Identify any conflicting patterns or implementations
```

### 2.2 **Validate Folder Paths**

**CRITICAL**: Ensure all referenced paths actually exist:

```
- Check if target SubApp directories exist
- Verify component/service directories are valid
- Confirm database schema paths are correct
- Validate any referenced documentation paths
```

### 2.3 **Check Feature Type Context**

Determine if this is a **lint correction plan** and apply appropriate references:

```
- If lint correction: Reference @lint-correction-playbook.md
- If lint correction: Reference @linting-and-typechecking-protocol.md
- If architecture change: Extra validation against boundaries
```

### 2.4 **Validate Naming Convention** üî¢

**MANDATORY**: Check existing files in target directory for sequential naming:

```
- List existing PRP files in target directory
- Identify the highest sequential number (e.g., 023)
- Prepare next sequential number (e.g., 024)
- Ensure filename follows format: XXX-[feature-name].md
```

## Step 3: Analyze the Kodix Codebase

### 3.1 Search for Similar Patterns

Use codebase search to understand existing patterns:

```
- For UI features: Search for similar components and UI patterns
- For API features: Find existing tRPC endpoints and patterns
- For database features: Look for schema patterns and migrations
- For state management: Find Zustand store patterns
```

### 3.2 Review Kodix Architecture

Read and understand the architecture:

```
- Read: @docs/architecture/README.md
- Read: @docs/architecture/subapp-architecture.md
- Read: Relevant SubApp documentation in @docs/subapps/
- Understand: Where this feature fits in the architecture
```

### 3.3 **Check Kodix Standards & Boundaries** üèõÔ∏è

Review coding and implementation standards with **STRICT** boundary enforcement:

```
- ESLint rules: @docs/eslint/kodix-eslint-coding-rules.md
- Architecture boundaries: @docs/architecture/data-contracts-and-boundaries.md
- Architecture standards: @docs/architecture/Architecture_Standards.md
- Lessons learned: @docs/architecture/lessons-learned.md
- Service layer patterns: @docs/architecture/service-layer-patterns.md
- i18n requirements: No hardcoded strings
- Multi-tenancy: Always consider teamId isolation
```

### 3.4 **Enforce ESLint Rules** üö®

**MANDATORY**: Ensure the plan follows strict ESLint rules:

```
‚úÖ REQUIRED patterns:
- useTRPC() pattern (NOT import { api })
- Explicit typing (NO @ts-nocheck)
- Promise.allSettled (NOT Promise.all)
- Validated env (NOT direct process.env)
- Organized imports (type imports separated)

‚ùå FORBIDDEN patterns:
- import { api } from "~/trpc/react"
- @ts-nocheck anywhere
- Unvalidated any type usage
- Promise.all without error handling
- Direct process.env access
```

## Step 4: Generate the PRP Document

Create a comprehensive PRP with these sections **IN ENGLISH ONLY**:

```markdown
# PRP: [Feature Name]

<!-- AI-METADATA:
category: prp
feature: [kebab-case-name]
complexity: [basic|intermediate|advanced]
estimated-effort: [hours]
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Step 5: **FINAL VALIDATION** üîç

Before saving, perform final checks:

```
‚úÖ MANDATORY CHECKS:
- [ ] All folder paths in plan actually exist
- [ ] No outdated instructions included
- [ ] ESLint compliance explicitly addressed
- [ ] Architecture boundaries respected

## Step 6: Save the PRP

Save the generated PRP to the appropriate location with **sequential naming**:

**Process:**

1. **Determine target directory** based on feature type
2. **List existing files** in target directory
3. **Identify highest sequential number** (e.g., 023)
4. **Generate next sequential number** (e.g., 024)
5. **Create filename**: `XXX-[feature-name].md`

**Directory Structure:**

```
docs/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ subapps/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [subapp-name]/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prp/
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-initial-feature.md
‚îÇ           ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 002-enhancement.md
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 024-[new-feature-name].md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core-service/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prp/
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-user-management.md
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 015-[new-feature-name].md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ architecture/
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prp/
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 001-system-design.md
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 008-[new-feature-name].md
```

## Step 7: Provide Summary

After generating the PRP, provide a summary:

```
‚úÖ PRP Generated: [Feature Name]

üìÑ Location: docs/[path]/XXX-[feature-name].md
üìä Sequential Number: XXX (next in sequence)

üîç Validation Status:
- Code alignment: ‚úÖ Verified
- Folder paths: ‚úÖ Validated
- ESLint compliance: ‚úÖ Addressed
- Architecture boundaries: ‚úÖ Respected
- Language: ‚úÖ English only
- Naming convention: ‚úÖ Sequential number applied

üìä Overview:
- Complexity: [level]
- Estimated effort: [hours]
- Components: [count]
- Tests required: [count]

üö® CRITICAL REMINDER:
This PRP follows all safeguards and coding standards.
DO NOT EXECUTE until explicitly ordered.

üöÄ Next steps:
1. Review the generated PRP
2. Adjust if needed
3. Run: /execute-prp [path-to-prp] (ONLY when ready)
```

## üö® **EXECUTION SAFEGUARD**

**CRITICAL**: This command generates plans but **NEVER EXECUTES** them automatically.

- Plans must be explicitly reviewed before execution
- Use `/execute-prp [path]` command for implementation
- No code changes without explicit user approval

## Important Notes

- **English Only**: All PRPs must be written exclusively in English
- **Sequential Naming**: All PRP files must follow numerical sequence within their folder
- **No Mock Data**: Always use real implementations
- **i18n Required**: No hardcoded strings ever
- **Multi-tenancy**: Always consider teamId isolation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive tests are mandatory
- **Kodix Patterns**: Follow established patterns in the codebase
- **ESLint Compliance**: Strict adherence to coding rules
- **Architecture Boundaries**: Respect all architectural constraints
- **Path Validation**: Ensure all referenced paths exist
- **Execution Safety**: Never execute without explicit approval
